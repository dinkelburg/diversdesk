<h2 id="challenges" class="section-heading">1. Challenges in Handling Group Bookings</h2>
<p>
Managing group bookings can be overwhelming, with multiple divers, shifting schedules, and various needs. Coordination is essential—balancing dive activities, assigning instructors, and handling paperwork all require meticulous planning.
</p>
<p>
Imagine a dive center preparing for a busy weekend, only for chaos to unfold. Some divers insist they booked a different package, others never received confirmations, and last-minute paperwork delays the schedule. Instructors scramble to manage schedules, turning what should be a smooth operation into a logistical nightmare.
