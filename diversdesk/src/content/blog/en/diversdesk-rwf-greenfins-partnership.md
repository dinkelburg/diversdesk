<p>
The partnership reflects our shared commitment to environmental responsibility. Diversdesk provides an all-in-one software solution that simplifies dive centre administration and promotes a paperless workflow for managing bookings and customer onboarding. By reducing paper use, Green Fins Members can directly strengthen their environmental efforts and lower their operational footprint.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
“This partnership with Diversdesk provides a practical way for our Green Fins Members to operate more sustainably. <br> By offering a paperless solution, we are addressing a key area where dive centres can reduce their environmental impact. We encourage all Green Fins Members to take advantage of this partnership to strengthen their commitment to conservation.”
<br><br><strong>JJ Harvey, Operations Director at The Reef-World Foundation</strong>.

</p>

<h2 id="exclusive-discount-for-green-fins-members" class="section-heading">Exclusive Discount for Green Fins Members</h2>
<p>
As part of this collaboration, Green Fins Members will receive an exclusive <strong>10% discount on Diversdesk’s management system</strong>. In addition, Diversdesk will contribute to reef conservation by donating to The Reef-World Foundation for every new Green Fins Member that joins through the platform. This means dive centres can support reef protection simply by improving their administrative processes with Diversdesk. <br>
<strong>Claiming the discount is simple</strong>. Members only need to enter their valid Green Fins membership code during registration on the Diversdesk website. Once verified, the discount will be automatically applied.  
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
“We are thrilled to partner with The Reef-World Foundation and Green Fins. This collaboration underscores our belief that operational efficiency and environmental responsibility go hand in hand. <br> By adopting Diversdesk, Green Fins Members can move to a paperless system, reduce their footprint, and automatically contribute to the health of coral reefs through every new sign-up.”
<br><br><strong>Bart Klein Goldewijk, Co-founder and CEO of Diversdesk</strong>.
