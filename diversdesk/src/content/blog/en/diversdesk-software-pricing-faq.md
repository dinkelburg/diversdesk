At Diversdesk, we believe in transparency, especially when it comes to the investment you make in streamlining your dive center operations and enhancing safety. We understand that when considering new software, one of the first questions that comes to mind is: **"Are there any hidden costs?"**
This blog post aims to answer that directly and provide you with a clear understanding of Diversdesk's pricing structure.

<h2 id="what-is-the-basic-pricing-model-for-diversdesk" class="section-heading">Q: What is the basic pricing model for Diversdesk?</h2>

A: Diversdesk operates on a subscription-based model. This means you pay a recurring fee (we normally bill annually) to access the platform and its features. We offer different plans tailored to your needs. 
Our **CRM-Go** plan, focused on customer onboarding, starts at **USD 27/month** and is limited to a maximum of 10 user accounts and 2 manager sheets. It does not include booking, planning and scheduling, or invoicing functionalities.
Our **Starter** plan, priced at **USD 42/month**, also accommodates up to 10 users and 2 manager sheets and includes planning & scheduling. However, staff calendars and email notifications have certain limitations in this plan. For a more comprehensive solution,
our **Pro** version costs **USD 64/month** and supports up to 20 users with a maximum of 5 manager sheets, along with 24/7 support and no limitations on staff calendars or email notifications. For multi-location companies or those needing more than 20 user accounts,
we offer **Enterprise** functionality with custom pricing determined after an introductory conversation. The exact price for the CRM-Go, Starter, and Pro plans depends on the specific features you require and the chosen subscription tier.
<br>

<h2 id="are-there-any-setup-fees-or-onboarding-costs" class="section-heading">Q: Are there any setup fees or onboarding costs?</h2>

A: In most cases, Diversdesk aims for a smooth and easy onboarding process. We generally do not charge separate setup fees to get your account up and running. We provide a **complimentary 2-hour training** session, which we recommend splitting into two parts: an initial hour to get you started after you've had a chance to explore the platform, followed by another hour once you're more familiar. This has typically proven sufficient for a smooth start. Next to this, we have comprehensive video training available in our freely accessible documentation hub. For very large or complex dive center operations with highly specific integration needs, there might be an option for customized onboarding services which could incur a one-time fee. This would always be discussed and agreed upon transparently beforehand.
<br>

<h2 id="what-about-training-costs-for-my-staff" class="section-heading">Q: What about training costs for my staff?</h2>

A: Diversdesk is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. As mentioned, we provide comprehensive online resources, including video tutorials and help documentation, that your staff can access at their own pace, at no additional cost. For dive centers that prefer personalized, in-depth training sessions beyond the included 2 hours (either online or potentially in-person, depending on location), we can arrange this. Any associated costs for such bespoke training would be clearly outlined and agreed upon in advance.
<br>

<h2 id="are-there-any-extra-charges-for-features-or-integrations" class="section-heading">Q: Are there any extra charges for features or integrations?</h2>

A: Diversdesk offers different subscription tiers, each with a defined set of features. Generally, all the features included within your chosen tier are covered by your subscription fee. We strive to include the most commonly needed integrations such as seamless connectivity with **payment gateways** including <a href="https://www.xendit.co/en-id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">Xendit</a>, and a **bookkeeping integration** with <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">Quickbooks</a> within our standard plans. These integrations can be activated upon your request. Outside of the default payment gateway's platform fees, we do not charge any additional costs for these integrations. Importantly, our Quickbooks bookkeeping integration is currently offered at no extra charge! If there are specific, less common integrations or premium add-ons in the future, these would be clearly indicated, and any associated costs would be transparent. We believe in providing value within each tier without surprising you with unexpected charges for essential functionality.
<br>

<h2 id="what-about-support-costs-is-customer-support-an-extra" class="section-heading">Q: What about support costs? Is customer support an extra?</h2>

A: We understand that reliable customer support is crucial. Access to our standard customer support channels is included in your subscription fee. This includes support during office hours for our CRM-Go and Starter plans, and **24/7 support** for our Pro plan. We are committed to helping you get the most out of Diversdesk. We go the extra mile by setting up a custom personal support page for every Diversdesk customer, where all your questions and relevant videos are uploaded. You'll also have your very own priority list within our ticketing system to keep track of any requests. Furthermore, we create a dedicated WhatsApp chat group for each Diversdesk customer, offering a direct support channel where we aim to answer swiftly and even record on-demand videos if needed, which are then also added to your personal support page. For certain premium support options or dedicated account management for larger enterprises, there might be different arrangements, but this would be communicated clearly. If there is a need for on-site training or special custom extended training beyond the included 2 hours, we do charge a small hourly fee, and this is only provided upon your request.

<h2 id="are-there-any-hidden-fees-related-to-data-storage-or-the-number-of-records" class="section-heading">Q: Are there any hidden fees related to data storage or the number of records?</h2>

A: Our subscription plans usually come with generous data storage allowances that are designed to accommodate the needs of most dive centers. We are transparent about any limitations on storage or the number of records within each plan. If your dive center has exceptionally high volumes, we would discuss suitable plans or potential upgrades with you openly, ensuring there are no unexpected charges.
<br>

<h2 id="what-if-i-want-to-upgrade-or-downgrade-my-subscription-are-there-any-fees-involved" class="section-heading">Q: What if I want to upgrade or downgrade my subscription? Are there any fees involved?</h2>

A: We aim to be flexible with your subscription needs. Upgrading your plan to access more features is usually a straightforward process, and any changes in fees would be pro-rated. Downgrading your plan is also generally possible, although it might result in the loss of access to certain features. We strive to make these transitions as smooth as possible without unnecessary fees, but we recommend reviewing the specific terms of your subscription agreement.
<br>

<h2 id="do-you-charge-any-booking-fees-or-commissions-on-bookings-made-through-diversdesk" class="section-heading">Q: Do you charge any booking fees or commissions on bookings made through Diversdesk?</h2>

A: No, unlike some booking systems that operate on a commission basis or charge booking fees, Diversdesk does not impose any additional fees or commissions on bookings made using our platform's functionality. You retain the full revenue from your bookings, with only the standard payment gateway processing fee (as charged by your chosen provider) applying. Nothing more. Our subscription model covers the use of our booking features without any per-booking charges from Diversdesk itself.
<br>

<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-have-a-subscription-shorter-than-one-year" class="section-heading">Q: Is it possible to have a subscription shorter than one year?</h2>

A: Yes, we do accept subscriptions shorter than one year. However, due to the time and resources invested in training, support, and setting up your personalized environment, we do charge a deposit fee for shorter subscriptions. This deposit will be fully returned to you after the completion of a 12-month subscription period. In the event of cancellation before the 12-month period, the deposit will not be refunded.
<br>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line" class="section-heading">The Bottom Line:</h2>

At Diversdesk, our goal is to provide a valuable and transparent service. We believe in clear pricing structures and aim to avoid hidden costs. The majority of your investment will be your recurring subscription fee, which covers access to the platform, standard features, and our robust support resources. Any potential additional costs for things like highly customized onboarding or extended in-person training are on request and would be communicated openly and agreed upon beforehand.
