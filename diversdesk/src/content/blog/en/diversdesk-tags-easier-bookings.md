<h2 id="why-tags" class="section-heading">Tired of Booking Chaos? Here's Why We Built the Tags Feature</h2>
<p>
In my opinion, one of the biggest challenges for dive centres with a lot of activities is just staying organised. You might offer courses, fun dives, snorkeling, private trips, equipment rental, and more. When it’s time to make a booking, it can be a bit overwhelming to scroll through all the products and try to find the right one.
</p>
<p>
After reading this <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/growth-strategies/10-ways-to-save-time-as-a-small-business-owner/480416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">article</a>, I realised that as a small business owner, finding ways to save time is essential. That’s why we created the Tags feature. It’s there to help you organise all of that in a way that makes booking easier and gives you more time to focus on the other important things you need to do.
</p>

<h2 id="what-tags-do" class="section-heading">So, What Exactly Do These "Tags" Do?</h2>
<p>
Think of tags as super smart labels. You can add them to any of your products so that later, when you are in the middle of creating a booking in <a href="https://www.diversdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">Diversdesk</a>, these tags let you quickly filter your view and only see the activities you need. Maybe you think this sounds small. But it is often the smaller tasks, the ones you barely think about, that end up saving you the most time <a href="https://graduatecoach.co.uk/blog/small-tasks-that-save-you-big-time-in-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">(source)</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s be honest. When you’ve got 30 or 40 different products on your list, things can get messy really fast. Like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/01/05/time-is-money-in-business-dont-give-away-your-time-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">article</a> said, in business, time is really important. That’s why I think of tags as your shortcut through the clutter. You just click the tag you need, and suddenly you're only looking at fun dives, or just courses, or whatever group you’ve set up. No more endless scrolling or second guessing. In my view, it turns booking into something way more efficient. Like opening a drawer and finding exactly what you need instead of digging through a pile of stuff you don’t. It just works.

<h3>1. Creating and Connecting Tags to Your Products</h3>
<p>
We’ll show you how to make tags in just a few clicks. It’s super easy. And the nice thing is, <a href="https://www.diversdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">Diversdesk</a> already gives you a bunch of useful ones right out of the box, like Courses, Fun Diving, Snorkelling, 1 Dive, or 2 Dive. So you don’t need to set those up yourself. Now, if you’ve got something a bit more specific to your dive centre, like a Sunday-only trip or a Special Promo, you can easily create your own tags. I think this is where the feature really shines. You get to label your products in a way that actually matches how you run things.

<h3>2. Seeing Tags in Action During Booking</h3>
<p>
Once your tags are set up, we’ll take you through how they work in real-time. Imagine you’ve got 40 products listed. Instead of scrolling through all of them, you just click one tag and you’re instantly looking at only what’s relevant.

<h2 id="conclusion" class="section-heading">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>

You might not think about them much, but once you start using them, everything just feels smoother and way less chaotic. If you haven't given our <a href="https://www.diversdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">Diversdesk</a>Tags feature a try yet, maybe now's the perfect time to dive in! Set up a few tags, test them out, and we bet you’ll soon be wondering how you ever managed without them.
