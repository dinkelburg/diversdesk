<h2 id="top-reasons-to-sell-non-diving-items-in-your-dive-shop" class="section-heading">Top Reasons to Sell Non-Diving Items in Your Dive Shop</h2>
<p>
I think a lot of dive shops focus so much on gear that they forget there is a whole world of other stuff divers are happy to buy. In my opinion, once someone has their basics like a mask, fins, wetsuit, and maybe even a dive computer, they are not done. If anything, that is when the fun shopping actually begins.
</p>
<p>
What I have noticed is that some of the best-selling items in a dive shop are not dive gear at all. They are the little things. The ones people grab while waiting for their buddy or checking in for a dive. The <a href="https://fluentco.com/content/the-power-of-impulse-buy-in-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #F86545">impulse buys</a>. The ones they do not think about until they see them and go, yes, I could use that. I think these kinds of products are easier to sell and often more profitable too. They meet a need the customer did not even realise they had until it was sitting right in front of them.
</p>

<h2 id="understanding-why-people-buy-two-types-of-non-gear-sales" class="section-heading">Understanding Why People Buy: Two Types of Non-Gear Sales</h2>
<p>
Not every sale happens because someone walked into the shop with a clear intention. Some purchases are planned, but a lot of them just sort of... happen. Over time, I’ve noticed that non-diving product sales tend to fall into two simple categories.
</p>
<p>
The first one is the urgent kind. These are things people realise they need at the last minute. They forgot to bring sunscreen. Their phone isn't waterproof. Maybe their dry bag gave up that morning. They weren’t looking for these things when they arrived, but once they spot them on the shelf, it clicks. In my view, this kind of sale is all about timing and convenience. They see it, they need it, they buy it.
</p>
<p>
The second type is more emotional like mentioned in <a href="https://fluentco.com/content/the-power-of-impulse-buy-in-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">this article</a>. These are the souvenirs. The t-shirt with your dive shop’s name. A bottle with your logo. Something small that lets them take a piece of the experience home. I think people buy these because they want to feel connected to the place or the memory. It’s not about practicality. It’s about meaning.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, both kinds are valuable. And I think the smartest dive shops create space for both, the necessary and the sentimental.
</p>

<h2 id="non-diving-products-worth-having-on-your-shelves" class="section-heading">Non-Diving Products Worth Having on Your Shelves</h2>
<p>Here are five items I think every dive shop should consider selling besides dive gear:</p>

<h3>Reef-Safe Sunscreen</h3>
<p>
People forget sunscreen all the time. They show up ready to dive or snorkel and only realise they need it when the sun’s already beating down. That’s why I think having sunscreen on hand is one of the easiest, most useful things a dive shop can offer. It’s an urgent buy, a last-minute save. And if you stock reef-safe brands, even better. <a href="https://savethereef.org/about-reef-save-sunscreen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">Here’s an article</a> worth checking out. You’re not just protecting your customers from sunburn, you’re helping protect the ocean too.
</p>

<h3>Dry Bags and Waterproof Phone Cases</h3>
<p>
These are a lifesaver for the forgetful ones. I have seen so many divers realise last minute they have nowhere dry to put their phone or wallet. Small dry bags and waterproof cases are a must-have. They do not take much shelf space and they sell themselves with one look out at the water.
</p>

<h3>Dive-Themed Apparel</h3>
<p>
This one is all about the memory. Branded shirts, rash guards, hats with your dive shop logo or even something funny about diving. People want to take something back home, especially if they had a great time. I think selling these turns your divers into your walking ambassadors.
</p>

<h3>Snacks and Drinks</h3>
<p>
After two dives, people are hungry. And thirsty. Having some light snacks or electrolyte drinks ready to go makes your shop feel more welcoming. You are not just selling food, you are offering comfort. I think it makes a bigger difference than you realise.
</p>

<h3>Logbooks and Stickers</h3>
<p>
New divers are usually excited to start recording their dives. Returning divers are often the ones who forgot their logbook at home. And stickers are just fun. Whether it is a turtle, your logo, or a little “I survived my dive” badge, people love sticking them on tanks and laptops. These are low-cost items with a high feel-good factor.
</p>

<p>
Once you’ve got a solid strategy for what to sell, the next step is making sure your system can actually keep up with it. This is where <a href="https://www.diversdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">Diversdesk</a> can support you with the right tools. Since it includes a built-in POS system, you don’t have to switch between platforms or guess where your sales are going. Everything is in one place.
</p>

<p>Here’s how the POS system in <a href="https://www.diversdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">Diversdesk</a> helps your dive shop:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Track sales trends to see exactly what customers are buying and when</li>
  <li>Easily add retail items to a customer’s booking during the checkout process</li>
  <li>Manage inventory automatically with low-stock alerts to avoid running out</li>
  <li>Export clear, organized reports to share with your team or accountant (coming in the next update!)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I believe when your POS system is this connected, it becomes more than just a cash register. It turns into a tool that supports your entire business.
</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts" class="section-heading">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
I think non-diving products are more than just a side hustle for dive shops. They are a smart way to boost revenue, meet customer needs, and create a more memorable experience. From sunscreen to stickers, these small items often make a big impact. And with a system like <a href="https://www.diversdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">Diversdesk</a> keeping everything organized, you are not just selling more. You are doing it with less stress and more confidence. In my view, that is exactly what a busy dive shop needs.
