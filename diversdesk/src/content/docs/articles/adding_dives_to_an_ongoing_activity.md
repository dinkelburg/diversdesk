### Use case: 
A customer decides to join for an x amount of diving days with a flexible amount of dives. Both the duration and amount of dives are in this case undecided. 

This user case can be dealt with in 2 different ways:
<br>**1.** [Using add-ons for additional dives](#method-1-using-add-ons-for-additional-dives-recommended)
<br>**2.** [Changing or editing the base-product](#method-2-change-the-base-product-to-match-the-amount-of-dives)

### Method 1. Using Add-ons for additional dives (recommended)

We kick off by creating a suitable add-on that can be used for any additional dives decided upon after the activity creation.
In our example this price is used as a price/dive for 5 dives or more.
<br>**1.** Navigate to the 'Add-on' page.
<br>**2.** Fill the add-on Name, price, currency and type and create the add-on
<br>(Type options: Per day, Per dive, Per trip or One time fee)
<br>**3.** Your new add-on is now listed and ready to be connected

Connect your created add-ons as follows: 
<br>**1.** Navigate to the product overview via 'My page' or the 'Products' page.
<br>**2.** Select the desired product(s) to connect your add-on(s)
<br>**3.** Edit the product in question
<br>**4.** Scroll down to the 'add add-on' select field and Connect the desired add-on(s) through the drop-down menu
![Creating an add-on for additional dives](/images/Connect_add-on_to_product.png)

Next, we navigate back to our planner screen and:
<br>**1.** Add/create an activity, 
<br>**2.** Select a base-product with a number of dives you know for certain your customer is going to participate in. This can easily be done by selecting one of your existing products
<br>**3.** The duration and number of dives are taken over from your base-product

**Adding dives**
<br>Throughout the diving days, the customer decides to extend their activity. You can now easily add these additional dives to the booking through one of the created add-ons. 
Simply edit the booking and connect the created add-on, using the number of dives that are added to this activity. 
<br><br>**1.** Navigate to the booking and edit the activity in question
<br>**2.** Scroll down to the add-on sectoin and select the desired amount of added dives and save the booking. (In this example 4 pax are doing 1 extra dive, which means we select 4x an Additional dive) 
<br>**3.** The added dives are now shown in the booking overview and the price is edited accordingly

:::note[Note] 
Don't forget to update the duration if there are extra diving days added to this booking.

Below an example where both trip-duration and additional dives are edited

### Method 2. Change the base-product to match the amount of dives
Instead of using add-ons you can also change out the base product in order match the amount of dives & duration agreed upon.
<br><p>**1.** Navigate to the booking and edit the desired activity
<br>**2.** Click on the connected base product to delete this from the activity you're editing
<br>**3.** You can now select a new product. 
<br>**4.** Change the duration and price accordingly

<br>**5.** Once the duration and price are matching the new situatin, the activity can be submitted and changes are saved
<br>**6.** The new info is updated within the booking
<br>**7.** and the outstanding balance is updated accordingly
<br>**8.** Any forms that were completed before the changes will remain completed after the product update
![Update the input fields of the newly connected activity](/images/Update_desired_fields_of_a_changed_activity.png)

:::note[Note]
In case the newly added product has different forms connected, it can appear that preveously filled forms are missing. *Don't be alarmed!* Any forms that were filled/signed off and don't show after the product changes will remain saved within your secure database.
