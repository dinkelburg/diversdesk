## 1. Create a Quickbooks Account
If you don't have a QuickBooks account yet, you'll need to create one on the official <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">Quickbooks website</a>.

Once your account is set up, you can continue to step 2.

## 2. Connect Your Quickbooks Account to Diversdesk
Navigate to <a href="https://app.diversdesk.com/connect/production" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">app.diversdesk.com/connect</a>.

Click Login and sign in with your Diversdesk credentials.

Once logged in, you'll see your Connections page. Click the 'Connect QuickBooks' link to begin.

  />
</div>

If you haven't already logged in in step 1, you can now login to your quickbooks account.

After you sign in, Diversdesk will establish a connection between your QuickBooks and Diversdesk accounts.

**You're all set! You can now close this window and return to your Diversdesk workspace at {yourcompany}.diversdesk.com.**

## 3. Connecting Quickbooks to Your Payment Methods

Back in your Diversdesk environment, you can assign the QuickBooks integration to specific payment methods by navigating to **Menu > Settings > Payment Methods.**
