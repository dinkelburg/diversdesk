The Waiver page offers all the functionality you need to create a custom, well-designed waiver that goes beyond legal protection. This tool is designed to help you build trust with your customers by setting clear expectations, reinforcing transparency, and showing attention to detail in every aspect of your business.

Weâ€™ve released a robust set of features that allow you to tailor open text input fields for any scenario, ensuring each waiver is as unique as the services you provide. With these customizable options, you can add the exact clauses, language, and brand elements your business requires. 

<div class="w-full md:w-3/5 mx-auto">

</div>

By default the waiver page will show the available certification organisation waivers from the organisation your business is connected to. Those waivers can solely be viewed and not edited. 

## Creating a New Waiver
You can create a new waiver through the create hyperlink.

There's a few basic settings to set when creating a waiver. Those are described on the 'Creating Onboarding Journeys' page of the user manual. If you've missed those, you can find them below:

</details>

### Input Field:
To create an input field you can use the 'Input' hyperlink. This will create the following: 
```html
{% input value= /%} 
```
A value is expected behind the compare sign =. You can fill the prefill your desired text or 'Insert' one of the available attributes.
:::note[Note]
Keep in mind that a value is expected, leaving the input value empty as shown above does not make your field appear.
:::

*Optional default values in the input field:*
- *participant* Custom
- *operator*
- *Custom*

Selecting both 'Input' and **'participant'** after each other will create the following.
```html
{% input value=$participant /%} 
```
Selecting both 'Bold' and **'operator'** after each other will create the following.
```html
**{% $operator %}**
```
