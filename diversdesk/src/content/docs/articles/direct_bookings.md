Below you will read the ins and outs of the **1st iteration**, which is a redirect form your website, or a link you share with your customers that points to either **'My Page'** or directly to **the activity** wihin your Diversdesk Environment.

### When to use Direct Bookings
The direct booking functionality is created, so you can receive **direct bookings through your website**, or simply allowing your customers to **select an activity and activity date** instead of a 'normal' registration where you are in control of the date and activity selected.

:::note[Note]
Direct bookings are **directly scheduled in your planner** and distincted by a 'direct booking' badge and alter color.
:::

### How to use Direct Bookings
Once activated, the Direct booking functionality can be accessed through your 'My Page' where opening any activity card shows the 'Book now!' button instead of an 'Inquiry'button.

### The 3 types of redirect 

#### Redirect to 'My Page'
You can simply use the URL to 'My Page' from any location on your website or by sharing it with your customer and your customer can walk through the process of selecting an activity and actually booking it in on a selected date. 
:::tip[Tip]
You can share the URL to 'My Page' with a specific category expanded. to do this, you simply paste **?activity={activity-category}** behind the default URL to 'My page'. </br>
e.g. for Fun Diving, the url would read: **{default_url_to_My_Page}?activity=fun-diving** </br>
Feel free to get in touch if you need a hand setting this up.

#### Redirect to the Acivity
If it's already known what activity your customer is participating in, but you want to give your customers the freedom to select their own activity date, you can share the link directly to the activity in question. From here your customer can read about the activity and start the registration process.

#### Directly to the Registration Process
If you solely want your customer to register and not show any activity details, you can choose to redirect to, or share the hyperlink behind the 'Book now!' button of a chosen acivity.

### Customer Flow
The customer flow consists out of 3 steps.

#### Step 1
Once your customers clicks on 'Book now!' they are redirected to the a page where they select the activity and date and fill the minimum necessary details needed to create a booking.
:::tip[Email notifications]
An email notification is triggered after completing step 1 to both you and your customer.

  <img src="/images/direct_booking_step_1.png" alt="Direct booking or Self-booking option" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</div>

#### Step 2
During step 2, your customer is lead to the registration form of the onboarding journey that's connected to the activity in question. 

#### Step 3
After completing the form, the customer is lead to their registration page and is asked to fill any required additional paperwork.
