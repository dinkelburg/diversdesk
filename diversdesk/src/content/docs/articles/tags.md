To more efficiently filter specific products in your product/activity list, we have introduced Tags. Tags allow you to quickly jump to a specific product/activity. In addition to tags, there are default sub-categories for each activity type made available to you. These can be found on the 'Products' page and during activity creation.

## Filtering through Tags & Sub-Categories

On your product page, you will find filter options to quickly find the product you're looking for.

<div class="w-full md:w-3/5 mx-auto">
  <img 
    src="/images/selecting_product_page.png" 
    alt="Selecting the product page through the hamburger menu"
  />
</div>

Once on the product page, you will immediately see the different available activities and their sub-categories. There are 'fast-select' buttons available for each activity category. The sub-categories are set up by default and will differ for each selected activity category. This setup allows you to navigate to the product you want to view or edit in an efficient and fast way.

## Setting up Tags

Tags can be managed and created from either the 'Tags page' or directly from within a product. Below you will find a guide on how to best utilize both methods.

**Tags Page** </br>
The Tags page can be used to create and manage any tags you'd like to add to your activities/products.

<div class="w-full md:w-3/5 mx-auto">
  <img 
    src="/images/navigating_to_the_tags_page.png" 
    alt="Navigating to the Tags page through the hamburger menu"
  />
</div>

Creating a tag can be done through the 'Create' hyperlink. After creating the tag, it will be available to you while creating or editing a product.

<div class="w-full md:w-4/5 mx-auto">
  <img 
    src="/images/creating_a_tag.png" 
    alt="Creating a tag"
  />
</div>

:::tip[Note]
A tag will only become visible within the filters once it is connected to one or more of your products.

## Connecting a Tag to a Product/Activity

To connect a tag, simply navigate to the product where you want to add the tag, click 'Edit' and scroll down to the bottom of the 'Edit Page'. Here you will find a section called 'Select Tags'.
