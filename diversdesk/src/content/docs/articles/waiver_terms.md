## What are Waiver Valid Terms?

Waiver Valid Terms allow you to assign a specific validity period to any waiver you’ve created within your Diversdesk environment, whether it’s a waiver that requires a signature or one that’s read-only (checkbox). Diversdesk automatically monitors the validity period for you and customers that have signed a waiver, won’t need to sign it again for future activities within the validity period. This powerful feature ensures a seamless experience for your returning customers.

And we're not stopping here. The waiver valid term also ensures that your customers cannot sign a waiver when the activity they are participating in falls outside the set valid term time window. Waivers will only open for registration if they remain valid for the entire duration of your customer's activity, allowing you to focus on the experience of your customers, with the peace of mind that all the paperwork is well taken care of.

## The Need-to-Knows
### Setting a Valid Term
When setting up or editing a waiver, you have the option to assign a valid term that suits your dive center's needs, ensuring a submitted waiver remains valid for the specified period. You can set the Waiver Valid Term on the 'Waivers' page by either creating a new waiver or editing an existing one, then navigating to the Valid Term section.

### Responsibility
Even though we take away administrative burdens for you and provide reassurance that valid waivers are properly managed, it remains your responsibility to ensure that all information is filled out correctly. It's important to verify that Medical conditions or other circumstances surrounding returning customers that could influence the legal validity of a waiver have not changed.
By maintaining vigilance over these details, you can confidently rely on the waiver's legal standing, knowing that any potential risks or liabilities are minimized. 

### Conservative Approach
Although RSTC standards allow official waivers to be used for up to 12 months, at Diversdesk, we have chosen to take a conservative approach by setting a Valid Term of 6 months for all official waivers from your certification organization. Our experience shows that most returning customers either fall within this 6-month period or return after more than a year. By taking this approach, we aim to reduce the risk of changes in your customers' situations, ensuring greater safety and compliance.

### Factors Affecting Valid Term Expiry
There are several conditions that influence the length of a set Valid Term. Even though an activity may still officially fall within the set term, a waiver term can be reset due to the following conditions:
- Edits made to the Waiver
When a waiver is edited and saved, all connected waivers for activities that have not yet been signed are automatically reset. This means that a returning customer, even if their activity falls within the original valid term window, will be required to sign the waiver again. However, signed waivers for upcoming activities of new customers will retain their validity unless manually cleared by you.
- Clearing a signed waiver by a user with Manager Rights
Clearing a waiver will also clear any signatures and filled input fields from that waiver, requiring a new signature from the user.
:::tip[Word of Caution]
Be cautious when clearing a signed waiver used in two or more bookings. If a status is cleared during the 3rd or subsequent booking, it resets the waiver status for all bookings except the initial one. This may result in an incomplete status for waivers between the initial and the edited booking. To maintain accurate records, we recommend manually uploading a waiver to the affected bookings.
