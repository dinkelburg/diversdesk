:::note[Note]
Since the focus of our environment has been directed towards diving, the category 'Freediving Course' is not yet accessible through your planner. Therefore, we have grouped both 'Fun-freediving' and 'Freediving Course' products under one category. This arrangement will soon change, and you will be notified once it is updated.
