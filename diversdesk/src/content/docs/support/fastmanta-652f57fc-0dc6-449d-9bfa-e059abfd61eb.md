## FAQ
### Q: How booking form details come to system via landing page. 
**Q:** Can you show that to me or is there kind of demo booking form page I can test?<br>

### Q: How do we setup the registration form?
**A:** I want to ask you to have a look at this <a href="https://doc.clickup.com/2633992/d/h/2gc88-3955/fcf0a46a215e4ab/" target="_blank">Document.</a> 
I've projected our registration fields/options and created an overview how I've set-up your Onboarding Journeys.

I noticed you've created a Freediving Onboarding Journey, so that one I haven't touched. 
To get a better understanding about setting up the onboarding journeys, you can watch <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/ac3c1b550cbd4f4888116b99a29e9679?t=820" target="_blank">this chapter.</a> from the getting started video. 


### Q: Can I add more form details?
**A:** **Activity date & Activity:** <br>
Gotcha. Just to clarify, you're talking about the URL you want to use for customers signing up directly from your website, correct? <br>
Those are not customers you've already been in touch with beforehand. <br> 

**Activity Date:**
It takes a little work on our end, but that's certainly a field we can add. 
I've given you edit rights, so you can make comments within the [doc](https://app.clickup.com/2633992/docs/2gc88-3955). 


**Activity:**
Like date, also entitles some work, but can definitely be done.
Use case: If a customer is coming from your website and already selected this here, this can already be prefilled.
Perhaps we can 

**Hotel Details:**<br>
I thought I already added this to the DSD onboarding journey, but I'll double check. <br>

**Room Number:**<br>
Noted. They're added to your onboarding journeys.<br>

**Meal Preference:**<br>
Our current options are not sufficient? We've had requests to add actual meal options, so the actual available meals that day can be entered.
Until we make a customizable drop-down field, I'm afraid these will be the fixed options.
(I do realize that Gluten free is most like selected when someone has an allergy, but we've experienced some people just want to eat gluten free, hence we provided the option)

**Allergies**<br>
This open text field is present.<br>

**Forms:** <br>
Clear. We can implement those within 24 hours. 
Have you got the form numbers for me by any change?
