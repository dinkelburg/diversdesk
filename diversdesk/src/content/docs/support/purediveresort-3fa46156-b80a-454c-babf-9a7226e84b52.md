## Pure Q&A list

### Q: Can I print Bills </br>
**Q:** Does the system allow printing the bills? Generating an invoice and printing it on a small thermal printer?</br>
**A:** By generating an invoice, an A4 pdf is automatically created (for normal printer). Not sure what file format your thermal printer requires. We can always have a look at it.

### Q: Where can I find a Manual?
**Q:** Is there a youtube manual for using the platform? With a step by step manual of the workflow? </br>
**A:** Documentation can be found through: [https://www.diversdesk.com/quickstart\_guide/](https://www.diversdesk.com/quickstart_guide/)
Video training can be foud through: [https://www.diversdesk.com/video\_training](https://www.diversdesk.com/video_training)

### Q: How can I delete an existing booking?
**A:** Atm bookings will stay in the cancel tab. From there we will delete upon request. And the rights to completely delete be given during our next update.
[https://www.loom.com/share/324e71211b374ab180915f4e5a0f1578?sid=edc90d07-6e9b-4831-aead-1bddd2f7a959](https://www.loom.com/share/324e71211b374ab180915f4e5a0f1578?sid=edc90d07-6e9b-4831-aead-1bddd2f7a959)

### Q: Is there an Activity Log kept in Diversdesk?
**Q:** While registering a booking - is it possible to add a field mentioning who of the staff has made that booking? Should be possible to pick any of the staff or mark it as Agent or Other. Can it be a dropdown menu in the booking reference field?
**A: Activity Log / Staff history**
Yes, We do alreay track the entries/changes made and by which user account. It simply doesn't show yet on your end. We can ofcourse make this visible, but it entitles a bit of work.
**Sales channel**
Very good one. This has been a request on multiple occcasions and we can implement this one fairly fast.
**Current/intermediate solution**
For any missing entry fields, we've applied some comments that are booking wide or for a single customer. Pls find an example below.
[https://www.loom.com/share/889a74cbb5e44885b064d6b889ee11e5?sid=11d42051-ce73-4125-9fba-756fda52ab1c](https://www.loom.com/share/889a74cbb5e44885b064d6b889ee11e5?sid=11d42051-ce73-4125-9fba-756fda52ab1c)

### Q: Can I add pre-set text templates to a booking? 
**Q:** ⁠Will it be possible to add a custom text to the Message field of a Booking? So the guest receives the link where he/she needs to fill up the required fields with that text being there already? </br>

**A:** **Message template:**
I assume you meant a prefilled text in the comment section. At this point this is not possible. We understand this is something that is desired and have a ticket for this, but we didn't find this our highest priority just yet. Mainly because there's a fairly easy workaround for now.

**Current/intermediate solution:**
We suggest to keep a little notepad open with the text you'd like to drop here and simply paste it. </br>
[https://www.loom.com/share/9e405c41bd714880add425d471d9072c?sid=db1f10d7-a573-445b-8dc5-16c39f238034](https://www.loom.com/share/9e405c41bd714880add425d471d9072c?sid=db1f10d7-a573-445b-8dc5-16c39f238034)

**Q** That is one of the (if not the most) crucial things to have for us. A number of people who will fill out the form and consider that a booking without paying a deposit is very high.

The open notepad etc. is not a solution as it can be easily forgotten, left out etc.

Main idea is that the form the customer is filling contains all the information required leaving 0 space for speculations, assumptions etc.

### Q: Can I customize the registration form? 
**Q:** ⁠When the guest gets the link to the registration form is it possible to change the following in that form:
- make Stay non-obligatory field
- ⁠remove Weightbelt option
- ⁠remove Meal preference
- ⁠Own gear options - limit to full own gear (mask, regulator, BCD, suit, fins, SMB), full rental gear and other
- ⁠Make all the sizes mandatory fields
- ⁠Make Feedback mandatory field
- ⁠Add SSI Privacy Policy to the Forms the guest must fill up

**A:**
**Custimize registration form**
This is all possible. Exept perhaps how you'd like to show the rental and own gear.
**Add privacy policy**
This is fully customizable and can be added as either a signed waiver or added text with tick-box to the registration.
**Solution**
Please find both solutions in the attached video here: </br>
.[https://www.loom.com/share/270be82c26824ccc8675f5fdeaf6dad4?sid=5dc8a44b-b189-428c-9318-eeb75336b9ae](https://www.loom.com/share/270be82c26824ccc8675f5fdeaf6dad4?sid=5dc8a44b-b189-428c-9318-eeb75336b9ae)
For the SSI privacy policy. Is that a default waiver? If so, We're happy to add this if you (or our contact at SSI) supplies this to us.

### Q: Is it possible to remove freediving from the activity categories?
**A:** No this is not possible. On the product page the empty product categories are hidden by default though.

### Q: Does Diversdesk have an inventory system 
**Q:** If I am adding a merch or lost gear into the bill as add-on, will it deduct it from an existing inventory or that function is not available yet? </br>

**A:** No, this will (at the moment of writing, 10-07-2024), not yet be deducted. This feature has yet to be completed and released.

### Q: Can the Sales Channel (Person) be made mandatory?
**Q:** For me it is crucial that when creating a booking that will be sent to a customer later a sales channel (person) is a mandatory field. Later, when I’m generating a monthly report I can see who made this booking.

**A:** This we can add. We are currently already storing this data, but it isn't yet published.

### Q: ⁠Transaction input - Can I see how the deposit was paid and how the bill was settled for the certain guest?

**A:** Yes, You can select the payment method and amount. I recomend watching the video below.

### Q: Can we add a payment including payment confirmation to a booking?

**A:** With our fully integrated payment gateway this is all automated through. I'll demo it in the added video below. </br>
[https://www.loom.com/share/76ee8e88f63b403bbad1db00f64631af?sid=3f18ca7e-a356-4a8f-b06c-5ce309076d5b](https://www.loom.com/share/76ee8e88f63b403bbad1db00f64631af?sid=3f18ca7e-a356-4a8f-b06c-5ce309076d5b)

### Q: Can we have an option to upload a payment confirmation?

**A:** Payment confirmation upload is indeed a good additional feature.
Regarding the upload feature: While we recognize its useful, it hasn't been a priority because most communication currently occurs via WhatsApp and we've observed that our current users simply use WhatsApp to request and share screenshots. (Doesn't take away that this would be a useful feature to have).

Q: If I create 3 templates for each boat, will that mean that the system understand the total capacity as 6 boats all together?
**A:** No, templates are solely a pre-created trip to fast-select those when scheduling your day. The capacity of the day is solely depending on the scheduled trips on this particular day.
Please find the vid below to demonstrate the use of our trip-templates. </br>
[https://www.loom.com/share/0fd280057dfc4f088be7a578c80b055c?sid=cb2659eb-72d1-4d59-8474-820b1f3a93ed](https://www.loom.com/share/0fd280057dfc4f088be7a578c80b055c?sid=cb2659eb-72d1-4d59-8474-820b1f3a93ed)

### Q: Self Registration ➝ Dive and Stay and Learn and Stay Packages.

**Q:** System does not allow to self register a non-diving companion or a person doing different amount of dives or customize the package. The way it’s visible in the calendar (start - finish), extended view with all additional info. From what I see it can (but only to a certain extent) be done manually.
</br></br> **A:** Please vind an aswerk below in the form of a video: </br>
[https://www.loom.com/share/592e9f1dd14a446c89ccef4c628e2767?sid=791a1ab2-ff25-4ffc-8dbf-6355e8174635](https://www.loom.com/share/592e9f1dd14a446c89ccef4c628e2767?sid=791a1ab2-ff25-4ffc-8dbf-6355e8174635)

**Q:** I understand how to customise and edit the entries.
Here is what I’m talking about.
I can see from this screen that there are 3 packages ongoing. If I click on any of them - I will have an itinerary, pick up and drop off locations, all divers info, payment info, whether transfers has been booked and confirmed.
Same people who are in those packages are entered into the calendar as divers. As a separate entry, showing me the group they are at etc.
In diverdesk I don’t see the package in the calendar.

**A:** All the info you mention is shown in 1 screen, and this view can be customized. Summary what can be seen:
</br> ✅ what is ongoing
</br> ✅ Itinerary (perhaps more limited, but like you do in google, you can use the comment section to enter any info you like)
</br> ✅ Pick up and drop off is shown and can even be exported to google maps
</br> ✅ Confirmation can be changed by you within the booking. Comment section can be used for any additional notes
</br> ✅ Group automatically shown through the booking reference
</br> ✅ Payment info

### Q: ⁠Booking notifications ➝ 1mo, 2wk, 1wk, 2d
**Q:** We use a system of notifications for the bookings made with us in advance (Dive and Stay and Learn and Stay packages). We have an alert a month, two weeks, a week and 2 days in advance. Which allows us to avoid any mistakes (not assigned materials, transfers and accommodation bookings)
</br></br> **A:** Those we can activate on request. (within reason of-course). We already have notifications active for our payment gateway.
What you request seems very reasonable. That is no problem.
A good think to know is that we are also working on Whatsapp notifications you can use for staff. To replace your 'puzzle form' or photo of planning you share. As a first iteration we will provide a customizable template that assembles all data you want and you can simply copy this and paste it in the desired whatsapp conversations. Further iterations will support fully automated whatsapp notifications to your staff.

## Misc
### Desired payment info to implement in a booking:
Please mind that this is not your booking confirmation.
In order to confirm your booking we kindly ask you to fill the requested information and let us know which way of transferring a deposit works best for you.
Available options:
- transfer via PayPal in USD, EUR and GBP (IDR is not supported)
- wire (SWIFT) transfer to our bank account in Indonesia in IDR
- wire (SWIFT) transfer to our affiliated accounts (linked to our company account) in the USA, EU, UK, Singapore and Australia in the currencies of these countries
- credit card payment of the PayPal invoice (NO PayPal account required), attracts 3% surcharge, accepted in USD, EUR and GBP, PayPal currency exchange rate FROM USD, EUR and GBP TO IDR is calculated based on [https://ppcurrencyconverter.com/](https://ppcurrencyconverter.com/)
- cash deposits on the spot (based on the availability). We might be able to hold the spot for you, depending on the booking size.

We are a small dive operation, our capacity is limited by the spaces available on board our boats as well as dive professionals (instructors and divemasters) on a given day.

Unfortunately we are unable to confirm any booking without receiving full required information and a deposit from our guest.Upon receiving the required information and a deposit we will forward you your booking confirmation.
