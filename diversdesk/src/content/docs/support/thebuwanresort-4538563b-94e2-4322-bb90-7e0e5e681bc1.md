## Complementary training
You'll receive 2 hours of complimentary training from us. You're welcome to use this in a single session or split it into two 1-hour sessions. We recommend using the first training after you've become a bit accustomed to the platform, and the second at a later stage where we can walk you through shortcuts and focus on workflow optimization.
