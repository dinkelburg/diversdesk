    Add-ons are items or services that you can add to an activity or person within a booking. They are a powerful way to offer customization and to increase the value of your offerings. 
    <br><br>
    You can manage add-ons from the addons page under <strong>Menu &gt; Recourses &gt; Add-ons</strong>. 
    <br><br>
    From this page, you can create new add-ons and see which activities they are connected to.

## Creating an Add-on

![Creating an add-on](/images/user_manual/create-an-add-on.avif)

At the top of the Add-ons page, you'll find a section to create a new add-on with the following attributes:

**Add-on Name:** <br>
The name your customers will see.
:::tip
For the best display on smaller screens, we recommend keeping names short and to the point.
:::

**Price:** <br>
The price of your add-on.

**Currency:** <br>
The currency for the price. This field will automatically be filled with your default currency.

**Basis:** <br>
This defines how the price is applied and includes the following options:
- per day
- per dive
- per trip
- one time fee

**Default Quantity:** <br>
You can set a default quantity that will be automatically added to a booking.
:::caution
The default quantity is a fixed number. It will not change based on the number of people in the booking. We're working on a 'next-generation' add-on feature that will include a smart quantity option.
:::

**Allow Participant Choice** <br>
This feature lets you add an add-on to the participant registration form, selectable for your participant, which is great for upselling specific items like an action camera rental or a private guide.

See the section on [The Power of Upselling Add-ons](#the-power-of-upselling-add-ons) for more information.

### Alternative: Creating an add-on from within an activity
You can also create and connect an add-on directly while you are editing an activity. This allows you to stay within your current workflow. 

![Connecting the add-on to an activity](/images/user_manual/create-add-on-within-activity.avif)

After you've created the add-on, simply presh the refresh hyperlink, and it will appear in the drop-down list.

## Connecting an Add-on
Once an add-on is created, this add-on can be connect to an activity. You can do this through editing an activity and adding the desired add-ons. 

![Connecting the add-on to an activity](/images/user_manual/add-ons-on-activity-page.avif)

:::tip
From the add-ons page you can view what activities are currently connected to a specific Add-on.

## Displaying Add-ons on the Detailed Day page
On the **Detailed Day** view, you can add the **Add-on** column to display any add-ons connected to the person or the booking.

Through the customize button, you can tick the the add-ons checkbox to add the column.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img 
    src="/images/user_manual/add-add-ons-to-detailed-day-view.avif" 
    alt="Adding the add-ons column to the Detailed Day page."
    class="w-1/2 md:w-1/2 mx-auto"
  />
</div>

### Understanding Add-On Types
Diversdesk offers two distinct types of add-ons to accommodate different needs:

**Per person:** An add-on is selected by an individual through the registration form and therefore connected to this person. 
Example: A participant selected an UW camera rental during registering the sign-up form. This add-on is then automaticlaly connected to this individual and added to the bill. 

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 2rem; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <div style="flex: 1 1 200px; min-width: 100px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
    <img 
    src="/images/user_manual/add-ons-icon-per-person.png" 
    alt="Add ons per person badge and icon"
    style="width: 100%; max-width: 150px; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; padding-top: 12px;"
    />
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 2 1 300px; min-width: 200px; display: flex; align-items: center;">
    Add-ons that are connected to a person are shown with a 'single-person-icon'
  </div>
</div>

<br>
**Per Activity:** This add-on is added directly to an activity by a user with manager rights. Since it's connected to the activity, not to a specific person, it will appear for every individual participating in that activity.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 2rem; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <div style="flex: 1 1 200px; min-width: 100px; text-align: center; justify-content: center;">
    <img 
      src="/images/user_manual/add-ons-icon-per-activity.png" 
      alt="Add ons per Activity badge"
      style="width: 100%; max-width: 150px; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; padding-top: 12px;"
    />
  </div>
    <div style="flex: 2 1 300px; min-width: 200px;">
    Add-ons that are connected to an activity are indicated with a 'multi-person-icon' 
  </div>
</div>

:::note
The 2nd generation of add-ons is soon to be released and will be easier to connect and have more flexibility throughout the application.

## The power of Upselling Add-ons
Add-ons are an ideal way to upsell items directly through the registration form. Even if your guests didn't originally plan on purchasing an extra item, seeing the option can encourage them to select an add-on, generating more revenue for your business.
