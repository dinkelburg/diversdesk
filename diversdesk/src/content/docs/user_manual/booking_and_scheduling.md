### Input fields
Selecting your pre-defined activities, making the creation of a new booking lightning fast. You have the freedom to modify pre-filled information and input the following details:

**Booking Reference** 
</br>You can use the booking reference to add a name or number, facilitating easy recognition of the booking. When this field is left blank, an auto-generated reference will be created. It is advisable to fill in this field, as it can be challenging to distinguish bookings on the planner page without a unique identifier.

**Nr of participants** 
<br></br>This is a drop-down field, initially pre-filled with two participants.

**Meeting location and address** 
</br>Using the meeting location and address field enables you to export the pickup locations to google maps from your detailed day overview. *{article available soon}* 
</br>The address field uses google to easily find and select the location you are searching. This functionality makes it easier to find the desired hotel/hostel or homestay your customer is staying.

The meeting location has 3 options to select from:

*1. Meet at divecenter*
</br>This is the default selected option and will automatically prefill this address field with your dive center's location. 

*2. Meet at dive location*
</br>The dive location can be used for shore dives or at the location the boat departs.

*3. Meet at hotel/hostel*
</br>The hotel/hostel or homestay your customer is staying. 

**Activity start date** 
</br>The date your activity starts. This is pre-filled with the date selected when you began creating this activity.

**Meeting time** </br>
This is the time you are meeting your customer on the start date of your activity. 
Pickup/meeting times for the following days on a multi-day course are assumed to be discussed on the spot and therefore not embedded in our software.

**Price**
</br>The base price per person for the activity, excluding add-ons or discounts.

**Discount**
</br>Discount percentage given on the whole booking. *At the moment it is solely possible to give discount to a complete booking*.

**Message**
</br>You can leave a message for the booking participants here, which will be displayed in the trip and price detail section within the booking.

**Internal notes**
</br>Internal notes are only visible to you and staff members. Use this space to leave remarks, requests, or any other noteworthy information for your colleagues dealing with this booking.
