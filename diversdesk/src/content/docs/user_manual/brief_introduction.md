**Welcome to the Diversdesk user manual!** <br>
You can access our documentation hub at any time through the ‘Support’ menu item within your Diversdesk or Traveltruster environment. For convenience and to save space, guiding images are often displayed using mobile screens, but the functionality is the same on desktop.

**Best Practice** <br>
For best practice, we recommend you go through the steps outlined in 3, 4 & 5 of the [**'Quickstart Guide'**](/quickstart_guide/#3-personalize-your-company-page-and-enter-activities). This will ensure everything is configured correctly and create the experience we would like to give our customers.
