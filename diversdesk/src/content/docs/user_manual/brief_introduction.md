**Welcome to the Diversdesk user manual!**

You can always access this 'Support' environment through the 'Support' menu item within your Diversdesk or Traveltruster environment. For convenience and to save space, the steps are displayed using mobile screens, but the functionality is the same on desktop.

**Best Practice** <br>
For best practice, we recommend you go through the steps outlined in 3, 4 & 5 of the [**'Quickstart Guide'**](/quickstart_guide/#3-personalize-your-company-page-and-enter-activities) page. This will ensure everything is configured correctly and create the experience we would like to give our customers.
