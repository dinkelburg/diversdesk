## Creating an onboarding Journey
To successfully create an Onboarding Journey we will walk through a few steps. Below you'll find the steps for best practice.
<!-- 1. **1.** Setup your Custom Waivers
2. **2.** Set out the different journeys (and customize registration forms)
3. **3.** Connect the desired waivers to each Journey  -->

## 1. Setup your Custom Waiver
We took the liberty of entering the official waivers of your certification organisation. If you don't wish to use any additional/custom waivers outside the ones made available from your certification organisation, you can continue at step 2. 

### Create a Custom Waiver
Creating your custom waiver can be done through the following steps.  

<div class="text-grid">
  <div class="text-item">
    <p>Navigate to the 'Waivers' page through the hamburger menu at the left top of your screen.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item">
    <p>Through the 'create' hyperlink at the top of the page, you can create a new waiver. Editing can be done through the Edit hyperlink behind an existing waiver.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item">
    <p>Fill the required fields to save your custom waiver. By toggling in-between Preview and edit you can obtain a quick snapshot of your waiver</p>
  </div>
</div>

The following fields are available to you when creating or editing a custom waiver: </br>

Umbrella name for this waiver. This is used for you to recognize the waiver, regardless the different names per language 'Display name' used.</br>

**Valid term**</br>
The period a signed waiver remains valid or is open for signing to your customer. </br>

Determines if this waiver is shown as a seperate signed waiver, or embedded into your registration form as a tick box.</br> 

**Language**</br>

The dedicated name for the language you're entering. This is the name that your customers will see.</br>
