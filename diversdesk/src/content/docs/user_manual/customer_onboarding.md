<!-- Diversdesk stands out in its incredable flexible onboarding methods.

As a dive-center you can choose to:
- **1** Register customers through a created booking
- **2** Allow a stand-alone registeration through a customizable/generic onboarding page

## Register customers through a created booking -->
After the creation of an activity, the customer(s) can register themselves through a unique booking URL. Next to this we give the freedom for you to register the customer (partly or complete) for a personal approach.

From here there are multiple onboarding methods available. You can:
</br>**1.** [Share the Booking URL](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#1-share-the-booking-url)
</br>**2.** [Send a Personalized email](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#2-send-a-personalized-email)
</br>For existing customers you can select an existing registration from your database: 
</br>**3.** [Select an Existing registration](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#3-select-an-existing-registration)
<!-- - **4.** [Generic onboarding method](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#4-register-through-a-generic-registration-page) -->

Each method is described in the appropriate steps below.

## 1. Share the Booking URL

## 2. Send a Personalized Email

After creating an activity, a user with manager rights can fill the desired fields of the registration form. 
You can fill up all the desired fields on behalf of the customer, or simply stick to the bare minimum. e.g. Name and email.

:::tip[Tip]
Create a custom registration form without mandatory fields. This will give you the freedom to solely fill the desired fields in the registration form. More info [**here**](/articles/custom_registration_form)

An existing registration can also be found through the Register here button within the booking.

For returning customers you can select an existing registration from your database. All fields are prefilled according to the latest registration of this particular participant.
