### Intro to Diversdesk's onboarding flexibility.

From a broad perspective, you could say that Diverdesk supports two main customer onboarding methods:
1. **1.** [**Direct Bookings**](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#1-direct-bookings)<br>
This method involves creating a booking and sharing a booking URL with your customer. The customer can immediately register and pay (if payment is added), and their registration will automatically appear in your calendar and dashboard.

2. **2.** [**Self-Registrations**](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#1-direct-bookings) <br>
Customers register through a so-called "Generic Customer Registration Page," which holds all the onboarding methods you've marked as "Selectable for Participant." Using this method, you can easily allow any walk-in customer to register through a QR code in your dive center, even if no one on location has access to your Diversdesk account. Self-registered customers will appear as pending in your environment and can be connected to a booking at a later stage.

Both methods offer a variety of features to enhance the onboarding experience, which we will dive into below.

## 1. Direct Bookings 
By adding an activity on the Planner page, and thereby creating a new booking, you can follow these paths to onboard your customer:
1. **1.1.** [Share the Booking URL](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#11-share-the-booking-url) <br>
This is the most efficient way of onboarding new customers, since basically everything is taken care of for you the moment you share the Booking URL with your customer. 
2. **1.2.** [Send a Personalized email](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#12-send-a-personalized-email) <br>
Introduced for centers that want to give that extra personal touch and prefill certain data based on conversations you've had with your customer prior to making a sale. 
3. **1.3.** [Select an Existing registration](/user_manual/customer_onboarding/#13-select-an-existing-registration) <br>
Existing registrations can easily be connected after the booking is created.

Each method is described in the appropriate steps below.

### 1.1. Share the Booking URL

### 1.2. Send a Personalized Email
After creating an activity, a user with manager rights can fill the desired fields of the registration form. 
You can fill up all the desired fields on behalf of the customer, or simply stick to the bare minimum. e.g. Name and email.

Create a custom registration form without mandatory fields. This will give you the freedom to solely fill the desired fields in the registration form. More info [**here**](/articles/custom_registration_form)

### 1.3. Select an Existing Registration 
An existing registration can also be found through the Register here button within the booking.

For returning customers you can select an existing registration from your database. All fields are prefilled according to the latest registration of this particular participant.

## 2. Self-Registrations (Generic Onboarding)

### Generic Customer Registration Page
A customer can select one of the options you have created on the 'Generic Customer Registration Page.' You can find this page through the menu by navigating to â†’ Forms and selecting the button shown in the image below.

### Making an Onboarding Journey Selectable for Your Customer
On the Forms page, you can create onboarding journeys and indicate through the checkbox inside each journey if you want to display them on the "Generic Customer Registration Page."
1. **1.** Navigate to the Forms Page.
2. **2** Click Edit on the Customer Onboarding Journey you want to appear on your "Generic Customer Registration Page."
3. **3** Check the box to make this Onboarding Journey visible.

### Sharing the 'Generic Registration Page'
You can easily share the 'Generic Customer Registration Page' in the same way you would normally share a booking URL.

### Customer Registration Flow
Once shared with the customer, the customer can select the correct journey and fill out the appropriate paperwork attached.
1. **1.** A customer selects one of the options that best descibes them.
2. **2.** They can immediately begin filling out the necessary paperwork for their chosen Onboarding Journey. 
3. **3.** After submitting the registration form, the customer will receive an email with information. 
4. **4.** After completing the registration form, the waivers associated with this onboarding journey must also be signed.

Your customer will now appear in your environment as pending, allowing you to connect them to a booking.

:::tip[Note]
The Generic Onboarding method is ideal for accommodating large walk-in groups, as it can completely eliminate waiting times. It's also a great solution when someone managing the dive center doesn't have access rights to your Diversdesk environment or isn't comfortable with digital tools. From afar, you can easily manage and connect these customers to the appropriate activities.
