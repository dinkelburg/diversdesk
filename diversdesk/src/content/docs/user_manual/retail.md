<h2>2. Getting Started / Initial Setup</h2>
There are two pages available to manage your retail items. <br>
Under the Resources section in the hamburger menu you can find: 

- Retail Items (Webshop), and
- Retail Stock

We recommend starting from the webshop to setup your desired categories and products. 



<h2>3. Building Your Catalog and Managing Stock</h2>

The core of your retail operations begins with your product catalog. This section will guide you through adding new products, organizing your inventory, and tracking stock levels.

<h3>3.1. Creating New Products</h3>

To add a new item to your product catalog:

<ol>1. Navigate to the Products Section:</ol>

- From the Diver's Desk dashboard, click on "Retail" in the main navigation.

- Select "Products" from the Retail Module submenu.

2. Add a New Product:

- Click the "+ New Product" button, usually located in the top right corner of the Products page.

3. Enter Product Details:

- Product Name: Enter a clear and descriptive name for your product (e.g., "Mares XR Extended Range Mask").

- Description: Provide a detailed description of the product, highlighting its features and benefits. This will be visible on your webshop.

- SKU (Stock Keeping Unit): (Optional but recommended) Enter a unique identifier for your product. This helps with inventory management.

- Price: Enter the selling price of the product.

- Initial Stock: Enter the current quantity of this product you have in stock.

- Category: Select an existing category or create a new one to organize your products (e.g., "Masks," "Wetsuits," "Regulators"). This helps customers find products on your webshop.

- Supplier (Optional): If applicable, specify the supplier of this product.

4. Upload Product Images:

- Click the "Add Image" button to upload high-quality photos of your product. You can add multiple images. These will be displayed on your webshop.

5. Save Your Product:

- Once all details are entered, click the "Save" or "Create Product" button to add the product to your catalog.

<h3>3.2. Managing Stock Levels</h3>
Keeping accurate track of your inventory is crucial.

Viewing Current Stock:

On the "Products" page, you will see a column indicating the current "Stock Level" for each product.

Adjusting Stock:

To manually update the stock for a product (e.g., after a new shipment or a return):

Locate the product on the "Products" page.

Click on the product name to open its details page.

Find the "Stock" field and enter the new total quantity.

Click "Save Changes".
