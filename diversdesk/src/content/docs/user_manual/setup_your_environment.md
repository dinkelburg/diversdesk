There is a range of fields where you can input all the information and details available for this activity, and connect any add-ons available for this particular product.

:::tip[Tip] 
Using the 'Copy' hyperlink allows you can easily copy a product and solely change the data that is different to the copied product/activity.

## Add-ons
On the "Add-on" page, accessible through the hamburger menu, you can enter or edit your add-ons.

During the creation of an add-on, you need to specify if this add-on is valid:
- Per Day 
- Per Dive
- Per Trip
- One Time Fee

![Add-ons page overview](/images/Add-on_page.png)

Once an add-on is created, it can be connected to one or more of your products. This can be done through the 'Product Edit Page'.
![Edit an activity](/images/Connecting_an_add_on.png)

If you create an add-on from within the product you're editing, the "Add-on Page" will open in a new tab. Here, you can create or edit the add-ons as desired. Once finished, you can close this tab and continue working on the "Product Edit Page." Pressing refresh within your "Product Edit Page" will display the newly added or edited add-ons.

:::tip[Tip] 
Later, you can always navigate back to the "Add-on Page" to quickly see which products an existing add-on is connected to. Clicking on one of the product cards will immediately take you to the "Product Page."
