## Q: Why are the menu items not visible to me? 
**A:** If the menu items are not visible to you, this can mean a couple of things:
- **You haven't logged in yet** <br>
You can check in a heartbeat if you're logged in or not, through the profile icon in the right top of your screen. Does the icon have a grey fill orange outline, like the image below, youre logged in.

- **Your email hasn't been verified**<br>
If you logged in through the login dialog and haven't yet verified your email address, the profile icon might indicate you are logged in, but menu items will only appear after you've verified your email. 

- **The email address you logged in with is not connected to an account**<br>
If the above two points don't help you, it might be the case that you have logged in using an email address that has not been connected to a profile. Make sure to use an email address that has been given access rights to your environment.
