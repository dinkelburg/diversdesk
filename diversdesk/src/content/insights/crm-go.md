<h2 id="paperless-registration" class="section-heading">100% Paperless Registration</h2>
<p>
    This is more than just a convenience; it's a game-changer for your business. Your customers can easily register before arrival using their own devices. All required waivers, including the diver medical form, can be signed in advance, and the need for medical clearance is triggered ahead of time. Once completed, they can upload the signed medical evaluation for your approval, saving precious time on check-in day and ensuring everything is ready before their activity.

<h2 id="personalized-onboarding-journeys" class="section-heading">Personalized Onboarding Journeys</h2>
<p>
    Every customer is different, and their paperwork should be too. With CRM-Go, you can create tailored onboarding experiences by customizing registration forms, waivers, contracts, and terms. This flexibility applies to both certified divers and non-divers, ensuring the right documents are provided every time. This not only keeps you compliant but also shows your customers you're organized and professional.

<h2 id="customer-database" class="section-heading">Build a Powerful Customer Database for Marketing</h2>
<p>
    This is where the CRM-Go Plan truly helps your business grow. As soon as a customer completes their registration, their profile is instantly added to your secure, centralized database. This isn't just a list of names; it’s a treasure trove of information that you can leverage for effective marketing.
    With easy access to their full registration and activity history, you can:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 8px;">
    <li>Segment your audience: Filter your customers by certification level, last dive date, or even the type of activity they registered for.</li>
    <li>Launch targeted email campaigns: Imagine being able to send a special offer only to divers who have completed their Open Water course with you in the past year, encouraging them to sign up for an Advanced course.</li>
    <li>Create tailored communications: Send personalized newsletters or promotions that resonate with specific groups, strengthening your relationships and driving repeat business.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This feature allows you to turn administrative data into a powerful tool for growth and customer loyalty.
</p>

<h2 id="Custom-forms-and-automation" class="section-heading">Custom Forms & Paperwork Automation</h2>
<p>
    Draft your ideal custom waivers, terms, and contracts, reducing human error and ensuring brand consistency. Our library includes pre-configured templates that match industry-standard waivers from major certification agencies like <a href="https://www.padi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">PADI</a>, <a href="https://www.divessi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">SSI</a> and <a href="https://www.tdisdi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">SDI/TDI</a>, giving you a powerful starting point.
</p>
<p>
    For protection and security, every signed waiver comes with a secure audit trail, and you have the flexibility to add a second layer of security with optional OTP (One-Time Password) verification. This helps ensure your paperwork is not only compliant with data protection regulations like <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#F86545">GDPR</a>, but also fully secure.
</p>
<p>
    The system also creates an extremely pleasant experience for frequent and returning divers. With our smart paperwork automation, signed waivers remain valid for the specified term, so customers don’t need to repeat the entire process every time they visit. This simple feature saves both you and your most loyal customers a lot of time and hassle.
