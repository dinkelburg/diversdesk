</div> -->

<h2 id="agent-portal" class="section-heading">Empower Agents with a Consolidated Hub</h2>
<p>
    Reduce the manual email and phone communication latency that slows down your business. Each of your agents receives a unique login to a <strong>consolidated availability hub</strong>. From there, they can view live availability, create booking requests, and manage their own guest details while receiving automated reminders for expiring options.
</p>

<h2 id="pos-inventory-maintenance" class="section-heading">On-Board POS, Inventory & Maintenance</h2>
<p>
    Managing a boat means managing a floating retail shop and a complex inventory of gear. Our system provides a <strong>Full POS (Point of Sale)</strong> to handle on-boat purchases, ensuring easy billing for extras and retail items throughout the voyage. Beyond sales, you can manage your rental gear and tanks, and even schedule maintenance and servicing for your equipment. This ensures your fleet remains compliant and your gear is always dive-ready.

<h2 id="paperless-registration" class="section-heading">100% Paperless Registration & Automated Nurturing</h2>
<p>
    This is a game-changer for your pre-trip preparation. Instead of collecting documents via email, you send a secure link to each guest to complete their profiles, sign digital waivers, and upload <strong>medical evaluations and passport data</strong> before they ever step foot on the boat.
</p>
<p>
    Once registered, guests are added to your centralized <strong>CRM database</strong>. You can then use automated guest engagement (lifecycle marketing) to:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Send Trip Notifications:</strong> Automated reminders and follow-up messages via email or WhatsApp.</li>
    <li><strong>Nurture Leads:</strong> Target divers based on their certification levels or history for future safari bookings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="manifests-reporting" class="section-heading">Custom Manifests & Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>
    Generate all necessary reports for your crew and local authorities in minutes. The system allows you to download <strong>customised manifests</strong> that include diving info, equipment needs, and transfer details. Beyond the boat, you gain insightful financial and sales statistics, allowing you to track agent performance and commissions with ease.
</p>

<h2 id="pricing" class="section-heading">Simple Pricing for Your Fleet</h2>
<p>Our pricing is straightforward and designed to scale as your fleet grows:</p>
