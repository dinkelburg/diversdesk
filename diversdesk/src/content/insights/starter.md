    This is where the Starter Plan helps you build and manage customer relationships. As soon as a customer completes their registration, their profile is instantly added to your secure, centralized <strong>CRM (Customer Relationship Management)</strong> database.

This also makes it a <strong>100% paperless registration</strong> process. Your customers can register and sign all required waivers, including the diver medical form, digitally ahead of time. This saves precious time on check-in day and ensures everything is ready before their activity. Every signed waiver comes with a secure audit trail, giving you peace of mind and full compliance.
