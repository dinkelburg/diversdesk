### User case: 
A customer decides to join for an x amount of diving days with a flexible amount of dives. Both the duration and amount of dives are in this case undecided. 

#### Method 1. Using Add-ons for additional dives

We kick off by creating a suitable add-on that can be used for any additional dives decided upon after the activity creation.
In our example this price is used as a price/dive for 5 dives or more.

And connect these add-ons to the desired activity/activities. 
<br>**1.** Navigate to the product overview via 'My page' or the 'Products' page.
<br>**2.** Select the desired product(s) to connect your add-on(s)
<br>**3.** Edit the product in question
<br>**4.** Scroll down to the 'add add-on' select field and Connect the desired add-on(s) through the drop-down menu

Next, we navigate back to our planner screen, add/create an activity, and select a base product with a number of dives you know for certain your customer is going to participate in. This can easily be done by selecting one of your existing activities.

**Adding dives**
<br>Throughout the diving days, the customer decides to extend their activity. You can now easily add these additional dives to the booking through one of the created add-ons. 
Simply edit the booking and connect the created add-on, using the number of dives that are added to this activity. 
<br><br>**1.** Navigate to the booking and edit the activity in question
<br>**2.** Scroll down to the add-on sectoin and select the desired amount of added dives and save the booking. (In this example 4 pax are doing 1 extra dive, which means we select 4x an Additional dive) 
<br>**3.** The added dives are now shown in the booking overview and the price is edited accordingly.
:::tip[Tip] 
Don't forget to update the duration if there are extra diving days added to this booking.
