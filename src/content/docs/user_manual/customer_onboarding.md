### 2. Manager registers the customer (partly or complete)

##### Fill the desired fields (see 3a)
After creating an activity, a user with manager rights can fill the desired fields of the registration form. 
To do this, it is adviced to [create a custom registration form](/articles/custom_registration_form) without mandatory fields. This will give you the freedom to solely fill the desired fields in the registration form.

##### Use an existing registration (see 3b)
For returning customers you can select an existing registration from your database. All fields are prefilled according to the latest registration of this particular participant.
