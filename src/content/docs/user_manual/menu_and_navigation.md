## Workflow pages

### Planning

The planning page serves as the central hub for scheduling and organizing your trips and activities. From this single page, you can access a multitude of functionalities. For instance:

##### A day view and date picker
A simple date picker that allows you to quickly hop between days. <br>
An underscore below a date shows you if there is an activity scheduled on that particular day. <br>
The selected day is highlighted in orange. A blue outline shows the current date.
