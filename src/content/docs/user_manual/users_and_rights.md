Giving a user the appropriate Role determines one's editing and viewing rights. There are currently 3 categories:  

![Give a user read or write rights through the user role](/images/user_role.jpg)
- **1. none**  
- This means no additional rights next to the default rights of the staff member in qustion.  
- _E.g. An instructor without an allocated role can solely view his or her schedule and has no rights to see the general planning or other members their schedule._
- **2. Staf+ rights**  
- A user with staf+ rights can view all planning related pages, but has no rights to edit any content.
- **3. Manager rights**
- When given manager rights, a user can view and edit all existing content.
