So, you're dreaming of blowing bubbles underwater and exploring the magical world beneath the waves? Maybe you're planning a holiday to Bali and wondering, "Is Bali good to learn scuba diving?" or perhaps simply searching "Good to learn diving in Bali?". Well, let me tell you, as someone who calls this beautiful island home and has explored its many dive sites, you've definitely come to the right place!
Bali is a diver's paradise, and it offers some truly fantastic spots for those just starting their scuba journey. The warm, clear waters, incredible marine life, and abundance of experienced dive centers make it an ideal location to take your first breaths underwater.
Now, while Bali boasts incredible diving all around its coastline, if you're looking for the absolute best places to learn and really get comfortable, I have a few gems in mind: **Amed, Tulamben, and Pemuteran**.

<h2> Why these three, you ask? Let me tell you:</h2>
Imagine slipping into calm, bathtub-warm water (think a delightful 28-31 degrees Celsius – bliss!) with visibility that can often stretch to an amazing 40 meters. In Amed, Tulamben, and Pemuteran, you'll often find exactly that. The waters here are generally still, with little to no current, which is a huge confidence booster when you're focusing on new skills like buoyancy and equalization.

<h3>Amed: Laid-back Vibes and Easy Entries</h3>
Amed, on Bali's east coast, is a personal favorite for beginners. It's a charming area with a relaxed atmosphere and plenty of lovely restaurants to enjoy after a day of diving. Most of the dive sites here are easily accessible as shore dives. This has a couple of great advantages: it often makes diving a bit more budget-friendly, and it gives you ample time to descend gradually along the gentle slopes. This slow descent is fantastic for learning to equalize your ears at your own pace and really getting your buoyancy under control without the added pressure of a fast descent from a boat.

<h3>Tulamben: Tranquility and a Famous Wreck</h3>
Just a short 20-minute drive west of Amed lies Tulamben. If you're looking for a truly immersive and relaxed experience, staying in one of the dive resorts here can be wonderful. Imagine waking up and being just steps away from your next dive! Tulamben is also home to the famous USAT Liberty shipwreck, a fantastic dive site that you might even get to explore towards the end of your beginner course. Like Amed, most dives here are shore-based, offering those gentle slopes perfect for learning.

<h3>Pemuteran: North-West Serenity</h3>
Venture to the far north-west of Bali, and you'll discover the tranquil beauty of Pemuteran. This area offers a quieter diving experience, particularly within the protected Pemuteran Bay. The bay itself is an excellent spot for beginners, with a variety of sites to explore in calm, warm waters with minimal current. While Pemuteran also offers boat dives (including trips to the stunning Menjangan Island – a must-see!), the bay provides a safe and comfortable environment for those initial learning dives.

<h2>Shore Dives vs. Boat Dives: A Beginner's Perspective</h2>
The prevalence of shore diving in Amed and Tulamben is a real plus for beginners. You can take your time getting comfortable, practice your skills in a relaxed setting, and really focus on mastering equalization and buoyancy control along those gradual slopes. This is quite different from a boat dive where you often find yourself descending into open water for your safety stop.
However, don't shy away from boat dives altogether! Learning to enter the water using a back roll or a giant stride are valuable skills to acquire. So, consider booking a boat dive or specifically asking your dive center if they can take you out on a traditional jukung (small outrigger boat) to practice these entries. It's all part of the exciting journey of becoming a well-rounded diver!

<h2>What if You Prefer the South? Sanur and Padangbai</h2>
If you prefer to base yourself in the bustling south of Bali, don't worry! Sanur and Padangbai are excellent alternatives for beginner divers. Padangbai, located on the quieter east coast between Sanur and Amed, offers some great beginner-friendly dive sites.
If you choose to stay in Sanur, you'll find a wide range of dive centers and plenty of other activities and restaurants. While many beginner dives from Sanur will take place in Padangbai or further north in Amed and Tulamben (meaning potentially longer travel days of 2-2.5 hours each way), you'll also have easy access to boat trips to the famous Manta Point around Nusa Penida.

<h2>Island Life: Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida</h2>
The islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida are undoubtedly fantastic diving destinations. However, while dive centers here do cater to beginners and often choose quieter sites for courses, keep in mind that many of the popular dive spots around these islands can experience stronger currents and might be better suited for more experienced divers.

<h2>So, what's the best choice for you?</h2>

Ultimately, the best area for you to start your scuba diving journey in Bali truly depends on the specific experiences you're hoping to have during your holiday, we've made a little recap for you:
* For those who love the vibrant energy of the south, Sanur offers a great base with easy access to beginner dive sites (though be prepared for some travel) and the chance to see manta rays.
* If you're seeking a tranquil escape focused entirely on diving, staying in a dive resort in Tulamben or Pemuteran is an excellent choice. Perfect for couples or individuals who want to fully immerse themselves in their learning experience.
* Amed strikes a nice balance, offering fantastic beginner diving with a slightly more lively atmosphere in the evenings with its selection of restaurants and cafes.
No matter where you choose to start your underwater adventure in Bali, you're in for a treat. The warm waters, incredible marine life, and welcoming dive community make it an unforgettable place to earn your fins. Happy diving!
