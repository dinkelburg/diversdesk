<h2 id="paradise" class="section-heading">Why Nusa Penida is a Turtle Snorkelling Paradise</h2>
<p>
Nusa Penida truly stands out as a prime destination for marine life encounters. It’s home to various turtle species, with four of the world's seven sea turtle species being fairly abundant in Bali’s waters. But it’s not just about the turtles; the island boasts some of the most beautiful coral reefs in the world, teeming with a huge variety of colorful tropical fishes. What makes it even better? Nusa Penida is incredibly accessible, just a short 45-minute boat ride from Bali’s southeastern coast. 
</p>

<h2 id="spots" class="section-heading">Top Snorkelling Spots for Turtles in Nusa Penida</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crystal Bay:</strong> This popular spot is known for its awe-inspiring visibility and stunning coral formations. While snorkelling here, you have a good chance of encountering Green Sea Turtles, often seen gracefully gliding through the water, feeding on seagrass beds, or simply swimming around the reefs.</li>
  <li><strong>Toyapakeh:</strong> A vibrant marine site, Toyapakeh is teeming with colorful corals and schools of tropical fish. Keep your eyes peeled for Green Sea Turtles or even the occasional Hawksbill Turtle navigating through the currents. This spot is a common inclusion in many snorkelling tours.</li>
  <li><strong>Batu Mulapan ("Turtle City"):</strong> Located on the East coast of Nusa Penida, this site is referred to by staff as "Turtle City" because you can easily spot up to a dozen turtles during a dive. It's a truly beautiful place with diverse species of corals and coral heads.</li>
  <li><strong>Gamat Bay:</strong> The nutrient-rich waters of Gamat Bay attract an abundance of marine biodiversity, including resident Green and Hawksbill Turtles. This is also a common stop on many snorkelling tours.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="species" class="section-heading">The Magnificent Turtles You Could Meet</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Green Sea Turtles (Chelonia mydas):</strong> These are the most commonly sighted turtles in Nusa Penida. They are known for their vibrant green coloration and their impressive ability to stay submerged for long periods. You’ll often see them feeding on seagrass, or occasionally munching on corals or sponges.</li>
  <li><strong>Hawksbill Turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata):</strong> You might spot these unique turtles with their distinct pointed beak and beautifully patterned shells. They are known to feed on sponges, which are plentiful in the area’s coral reefs. It's worth noting that Hawksbill Turtles are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.</li>
  <li><strong>Olive Ridley Turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea):</strong> While less common, these turtles occasionally make an appearance in Nusa Penida’s waters. They have a rounded shell and are known for their synchronized nesting behavior on certain beaches around the world. If you see one, consider yourself very fortunate!</li>

<h2 id="ethics" class="section-heading">How to Snorkel Ethically</h2>
<p>
Snorkelling with turtles is magical, but it only stays that way if we treat the ocean with care. Always give turtles plenty of space and avoid swimming directly above them, so they don’t feel trapped. Don’t try to touch or feed them either, since that can mess with their natural behavior and even make them sick. Be extra mindful of where you kick or stand because coral is fragile and takes years to grow back. It also helps to book with a tour operator that truly respects the ocean and its creatures. And of course, take your trash with you. The less we leave behind, the more beauty there is to return to.
