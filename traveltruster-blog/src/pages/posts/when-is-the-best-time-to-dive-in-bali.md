Bali is well-known for its pristine beaches and beautiful blue waters. It’s no surprise, then, that diving is one of the island’s most popular activities. Bali diving holidays are becoming increasingly popular, as the island offers something for everyone (yes for everyone!) whether you’re a beginner or an experienced diver, snorkeler or a freediver. The clear waters and rich marine life make Bali a perfect destination for those who love to explore underwater activities.

Due to its equator-side location, the area experiences year-round tropical weather, with highs of 30 to 32 °C and lows of 24 to 26 °C. In Bali, there are two different seasons:
the dry season (May to September), which is characterized by dry southeast winds from the nearby Australian continent, and: 
the rainy season (November to March). High humidity can be expected during the period between October and April when there is often daily rain and quiet overcast days. The rainiest times are between December and February and the days are hot and steamy - truly tropical.

So when is the best time to take a diving holiday in Bali? 
The answer really depends on what you want to see and do while you’re here. The local Balinese also use a lunar calendar called the Saka. The ideal time to go diving is during Sasih Kapat, which is from September through October, and the worst time is during Sasih Kesanga, which is from February through March in the early months of the year.

Here is a rough guide for the months and general conditions for diving:

| Months | General Conditions |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| September - November | Best diving period |
| April - June  | Good diving period |
| December | Okay diving period |
| January - March | Not so good diving period |
